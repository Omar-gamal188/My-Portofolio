# Deployment Guide for GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy portfolio website"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/Omar-gamal188/My-Portofolio`
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: Select "main" and "/ (root)" folder
5. Click "Save"

### 3. Wait for Deployment
- GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your site
- It may take 1-5 minutes for the site to be available
- Your site will be available at: `https://omar-gamal188.github.io/My-Portofolio/`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 404 Error
1. **Check file structure**: Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
2. **Clear browser cache**: Try incognito mode or clear cache
3. **Wait for propagation**: GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to update
4. **Check repository settings**: Verify GitHub Pages is enabled for main branch

### File Path Issues
- All CSS and JS files use relative paths (`./css/style.css`)
- This works correctly with GitHub Pages structure

### Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Buy a domain from a registrar
2. Add a `CNAME` file in your repository with your domain
3. Configure DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages
